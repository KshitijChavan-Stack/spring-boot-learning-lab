This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning the Spring Framework and Spring Boot from scratch. It serves as a personal knowledge base where I implement and share everything I learn â€” from setting up the development environment, creating controllers and services, to building REST APIs, integrating views, and working with databases. Each commit reflects a specific learning milestone, making this repo both a practical reference for myself and a helpful resource for others starting with Spring development.
